An OpenStreetMap dashboard for <a href="https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks">OpenTracks</a>.
It shows a selected track with start- and endpoints on a map from <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> based on the <a href="https://github.com/mapsforge/mapsforge">Mapsforge</a> library.
The default is an online map, but offline maps are supported as well. With offline maps, there is no necessity for a mobile data plan.

The default map is provided by <a href="https://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap.org</a>.

Please consider downloading an offline map to decrease the server load and save your mobile data plan.
Some offline maps can be found here:

- <a href="https://www.freizeitkarte-osm.de/android/en/">Freizeitkarte Android</a>
- <a href="https://www.openandromaps.org/en">OpenAndroMaps</a>

Some maps require special themes to render correctly! These need to be downloaded and configured accordingly.

Offline maps can be downloaded via the menu "Map download" or by visiting the above mentioned websites and click the download links. Some browsers (e.g. Firefox) require a long click on the link and "Open link in external app" and then choose OSMDashboard.

Manual downloaded offline maps or maps shared with other apps can be opened from your Android device. Select the directory in the menu "Map directory".
